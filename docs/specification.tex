\section*{Project Proposal}

Samuel Xiang

\subsection{Introduction}

\quad The language I would like to design would solve the "problem" of designing turn-based RPG games on a computer.
This language would be able to generate a playable game with an interactable world and combat between characters,
while giving the programmer plenty of flexibility to add to the existing structure as they please. In essence, it 
would provide the programmer with an outlet that allows them to express complex creative ideas in simple ways.
\\ \\
\quad There are a vast selection of unique turn-based RPG's in the real world, but the genre has rules and restrictions 
of form that are almost impossible to break. As such, expressing the basic tenets of any turn-based RPG can be boiled
down to several patterns, which mean that a formal grammar is perfectly capable of encapsulating these tenets. However,
building these core ideas over and over again is redundant and time consuming, so a programming language should be a 
fun way to create these games with minimal labor. 

\subsection{Design Principles}

\quad This language should express lengthy ideas and systems of turn-based RPG games in simple English. From the technical
perspective, this program should generate a playable game to the users specifications within the scope of the language.
By playable, I mean a game that an outsider user interact with and complete without knowledge of the inner workings - like
an actual video game. Because these ideas are expressable in simple English, I would like to create a readable program without 
lots of weird characters that almost anyone could access and easily intuit. Because the creation of a game involves the creation 
of a fictional world, the program should almost read as a story or encyclopedia of this world. 

\subsection{Examples}

My language expects a text file of the .rpg format. Example: dotnet run "gamename.rpg"

Example 1. \\ 

There is a room named "Foyer" 
with description: "A modest foyer with not much to look at. Another person stands in the room.".
with objects: Playable character named "Samuel" with stats: hp = 10, mp = 10, atk = 10, def = 10, matk = 10, mdef = 10, spd = 10 and abilities:, 
Nonplayable character named "Katerina" with stats: hp = 10, mp = 10, atk = 10, def = 10, matk = 10, mdef = 10, spd = 10 and abilities:.
with connections: North is "Living Room". \\

There is a room named "Living Room" with objects: 
Nonplayable character named "Owen" with stats: hp = 10, mp = 10, atk = 10, def = 10, matk = 10, mdef = 10, spd = 10 and abilities:,

\subsection{Language Concepts}

\quad The language as I envision it right now doesn't actually have many moving parts - the set of primitives
I want combine nicely, and the most of the functionality/computation is hidden from the programmer. As such,
the programmer simply needs ideas to fill out the game. Primitives include type, name, stats, ability, and effect.
Using these building blocks, we can create characters, rooms, and objects, which is essntially all that we need to
build the game and the world. 
\\ \\
\quad Creating the map, executing combat, etc. are all things that the programmer doesn't consider - rather, they
create the guidelines that the functionality of the language operates within. The most important things the programmer 
has to understand are how rooms are connected and how stats interact. Characters are another core part of the language 
and the game, in that they will provide a lot of the meat of combat and the game's story. Most of the computation hidden 
from the user comes in the form of the effect type, which basically dictates the interaction of stats and objects.

\end{table}

\subsection {Remaining Work}

\quad I still need to implement two of the major combining forms, rooms and objects. Aditionally, I'm not sure how I plan
on implementing the effect type. The easiest way would be to have a list of possible effects that the user can use, but that
is inherently quite limiting. I also have to build implementation for the game itself in the evaluator.
